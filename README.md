# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to review the NYC bike sharing data for the month of August and identify trends. 

## Summary
I believe that adding temperature and percipitation data would add a great value to the story. Two additional visualization should show how temperature and percipitation impacts the number of rides.
